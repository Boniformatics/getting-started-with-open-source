# How To add attendee name locally using command line and editors

a new `.yml` file in
the folder `_data/attendees/`. In this tutorial we will show how we can do this locally using command line and editors.

Initially, identify and open your command line interface.

- Windows: use Git bash (which was installed on your machine when you installed
  Git).
- nix (another way to describe Mac OS and/or Linux machines : use the system
  terminal.


If we want to work on this locally from our computers then we first need to
bring down the repository. We need to `clone` the repository.

To clone the repository to your computer you need to open a terminal or Git
bash, navigate to the location you want to the project (for example),

```
cd Desktop
```

and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/getting-started-with-open-source.git
```

Before we start working - let's make sure our copy is up to date. Command:

```
git pull origin gh-pages
```

**WORK IN PROGRESS**.
